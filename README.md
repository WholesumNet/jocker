## Overview

Wholesum network is a p2p verifiable computing network. It builds on top of [Risc0](https://risczero.com/), [Swarm](https://ethswarm.org), [FairOS-dfs](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairOS-dfs), and [Libp2p](https://libp2p.io) to facilitate verifiable computing at scale. 

This library is a small wrapper around Bollard.
